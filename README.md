Word-Link
=========

This is a Java program for my Computer Science course that reads a dictionary of words with four letters. The user inputs a beginning four letter word and an ending four letter word, and the program searches for words that connect the begging and ending word and only differ 1 character from the pevious word. This program only returns the smallest word chains to the user.
